# Makes fetches and repo performance quicker by not pulling unnecessary remote

# NB: The refspecs from this configuration will cause `git clone` to not work.
# If this is applied to a folder being cloned, eg. global include of `includeIf`
# match, you need to instead use `git pclone`, an alias made to work around
# this. The problem is caused by having a duplicate refspec for `master` during
# cloning because the clone fetch stage includes a default refspec as well as a
# configuration refspec. cloning. This problem and a workaround is discussed in
